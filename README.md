Game
I had an extremely hard time with the movement system in this game. That's why it's not really a game yet. the rest is CAKE compared to making this chariot
move. So you get to the goal and it's all nice and cute.It's not much but alpha tester enjoyed it. I also showed it to my mom and she said it was relaxing because
you ge to the goal and win. Some of the feedback I got was for it to have more "Game". I think this is a good enough game for how much effort I put into trying to make 
this box move. It has the title screen and the pause screen and the win condition. It'll be better later because I learned SO much. Too much... I'm
going to bed now because the knowledge I got from coding the movement is so vast compared to what I knew before that I'm very tired. Thanks!
